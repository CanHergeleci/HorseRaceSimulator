## Project Description
<p> This project allows users to race horses with different attributes and configurations against each other. It has been designed using Java and JSwing for GUI development and built using object-oriented programming fundamentals.<p>


## Getting Started
<p> In order to download and locally run the horse race simulator, follow the instructions below.<p>

<h4> Dependencies required: </h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Java 17 or higher:</p>
    <p>This can be downloaded via <a href="https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/downloads/#java21">Oracle</a></p>
    <p>Ensure you find the correct version for your platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)</p>
    <p>Once downloaded, follow the instructions to install Java on your machine</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JSwing:</p>
    <p> This is included in the Java 17 download, so no need to download separately</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4> Instructions to run the program: </h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Download files to your local device</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Launch your machines terminal</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the files. To do this use cd and ls to change directories and list all current files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you are in the correct directory, use the command "javac *.java" to compile all files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the program is compiled, use the command "java Gui" to run the program.</p>
  </li>
</ol>


## Usage
<p> Once you have the program running you can follow the guidelines below to understand how to use the software </p>
<h4> Instructions to use the program: </h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In order to interact with the GUI, use the tabs at the top to navigate between the different sections of the program.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first tab is the ongoing race tab, you will only be able to start a race once you have created a horse.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to create a horse, navigate to the horse configuration tab and fill in the required fields.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The racetrack configuration can also be adjusted in the race configuration tab. Otherwise these will be set to the standard options</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you have configured these settings and have added up to 10 horses, you can return to the ongoing race tab and click start race. Wait a couple of seconds while the race is being simulated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the end of the race you can refer back to the statistics tab to view the appropriate statistics of the race. The previous race data will also appear there. If the program ends, previous data is lost. The ability to save data as well as show the best current time for specific tracks will be added later on. Same with the option to change the track shape.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you have finished using the program, you can close the GUI window and the program will end.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
